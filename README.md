# covid_dashboard

This is a work in progress. The goal of this project is to create a custom dashboard for viewing Ohio's COVID-19 data. The unique feature of this dashboard 
will be the ability to view snapshots of historical data, allowing for visualization for the progression of data. This dashboard will also offer more 
specificity in terms of data groups. For example, age ranges and sex will viewable individually for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. 

### Prerequisites

This program is meant for demonstration of capability only. It relies on a local server for pulling data; therefore, it will not be replicable.
